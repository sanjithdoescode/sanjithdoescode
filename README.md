- 🦾 **ML & AI Experiments** | The real magic behind the code.
- 💾 **Linux & Ethical Hacking** | Windows is comfy, but it's time to go deeper.

## Random Fun Facts 🤓

- I keep **70+ Chrome tabs open** at all times. Battery life be damned.
- My laptop is *good*, but should’ve been a MacBook. Regrets? Maybe.
- I'm probably overthinking my next iPhone upgrade right now.
- I appreciate real conversations. If you’re here for small talk, keep moving.
- Mood swings? Yes. Pessimistic at times? Also yes. But I keep it real.
